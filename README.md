# Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Game 

[Live](https://tjshiu.github.io/tic_tac_toe/)

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe game created by me, Tiffany Shiu. The technologies that were used was React for the frontend rendering. Babel, Cloner, Lodash, and Webpack. I wanted to create a user-interface for everyone to use and see. There are three game modes that you can play: Player vs Advance Computer, Player vs Basic Computer, and Player 1 vs Player 2. Restarting the game occurs when you click any of the buttons. I hope you enjoy the game. See below for details of the different game plays:

## Player vs Advance Computer
- This is the undefeatble Advance Computer. No matter what you play, it will either result in a Cat's game(no one wins) or the Computer wins. 

## Player vs Basic Computer
- This is the Basic Computer. The Basic Computer doesn't block your wins but will try to win if it can. 

## Player 1 vs Player 2
- Play with a friend who is with you! This allows anyone who wants to play another person to play.
