# Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Game 

[Live](https://tjshiu.github.io/tic_tac_toe/)

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe game created by me, Tiffany Shiu. The technologies that were used was React for the frontend rendering. Babel, Cloner, and Webpack. I wanted to create a user-interface for everyone to use and see. My goal was to have a basic computer that only picks a winning move for the computer to win or a random empty spot. There is also a player to player interaction as a possible option. Restarting the game occurs when you click either of the buttons. As for improvements for the project, a minimax algorithm would be nice for a super computer that will always either win or create a cat's game (no one wins). I hope you enjoy the game.
